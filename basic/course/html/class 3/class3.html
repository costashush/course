    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3 class="italic-text">The blend</h3>
    <p class="italic-text">Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack
        the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually
        drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth,
        thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.

    </p>
    <h3>Thikaning the blend</h3>
    <p>Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a
        steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency
        of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the
        starch in the flour to swell, but thereâ€™s no need.

    </p>
    <h3>Cooking first side</h3>
    <p>Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter
        into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter
        into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter
        from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath
        after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.

    </p>
    <h3>Flipping</h3>
    <p>Flipping pancakes:Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make
        sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning
        out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You
        can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.

    <h1 id="toast">French Toast</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="enhance">This recipe is perfect! I make it with homemade cinnamon bread from the farmers market we have on Saturdays so it soaks
        up a lot if you're not quick and careful. If you think it's like scrambled eggs you're clearly letting it soak too
        long. I do a quick dip and fry as instructed and it's perfect. My husband doesn't usually like breakfast food but
        asks for this on Sundays :) we love it with no modifications!</p>
